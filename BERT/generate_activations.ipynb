      "i could recognize , at first glance , china from arizona .\n",

      "i have seen them from close up .\n",

      "whenever i met one of them that seemed a bit more clear - sighted , i tried the experiment of showing them my drawing number one , that i ' ve always kept .\n",
      "i wanted to know if they were really a person of true understanding .\n",

      "for me it was a matter of life or death .\n",
      "i had hardly enough water to drink for a week .\n",
      "the first night i went to sleep on the sand , a thousand miles from any human habitation .\n",
      "i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean .\n",

      "i was discouraged in my career as a painter by the grownups , at the age of six , and i hadn ' t learned to draw anything except boa constrictors , closed and open .\n",
      "i stared at this sudden apparition wide eyed with astonishment .\n",

      "he looked nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert , a thousand miles from any inhabited region .\n",
      "when i finally managed to speak , i said : “ but — what are you doing here ? ”\n",
      "and he repeated , very slowly , as if it was something very serious : “ please ...\n",
      "draw me a sheep ... ”\n",
      "when a mystery is too overpowering , one dare not disobey .\n",
      "absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death , i took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen .\n",
      "but then i remembered that i had mainly studied geography , history , arithmetic and grammar , and i told the little fellow ( a little crossly ) that i didn ’ t know how to draw .\n",
      "he replied : “ it doesn ' t matter .\n",
      "draw me a sheep . ”\n",
      "as i ’ d never drawn a sheep , i redrew for him one of the only two drawings that i was capable of .\n",
      "the one of the closed boa constrictor .\n",
      "and i was astounded to hear the little fellow respond : “ no !\n",
      "no !\n",
      "i don ’ t want an elephant inside a boa constrictor .\n",
      "a boa constrictor is very dangerous , and an elephant is very cumbersome .\n",
      "where i live everything is very small .\n",
      "i need a sheep .\n",
      "draw me a sheep . ”\n",
      "so i drew .\n",
      "he looked carefully , then said : “ no !\n",
      "this one ’ s already very sick .\n",
      "make another one . ”\n",
      "i drew again : my friend smiled gently and indulgently : “ you can see yourself ...\n",
      "this isn ’ t a sheep , it ' s a ram .\n",
      "it has horns ...\n",
      "“ so once again i redid my drawing : but it was rejected , like the previous ones : “ this one ’ s too old .\n",
      "i want a sheep that will live a long time . ”\n",
      "so , getting impatient , as i was eager to start dismantling my engine , i hastily sketched this drawing : and i snapped : “ this here is the box .\n",
      "the sheep you want is inside . ”\n",
      "but i was very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up : “ it ' s exactly the way i wanted !\n",
      "do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass ? ”\n",
      "“ why ? ”\n",
      "“ because where i ' m from everything is very small ... ”\n",
      "“ there will certainly be enough .\n",
      "i gave you a very small sheep . ”\n",
      "he leaned his head towards the drawing : “ not that small ...\n",
      "look !\n",
      "he ' s fallen asleep ... ”\n",
      "and that ' s how i met the little prince .\n",
      "it took me a long time to find out where he came from .\n",
      "the little prince , who asked me many questions , never seemed to hear my own .\n",
      "it was the words spoken by chance that , little by little , revealed everything to me .\n",
      "so , when he saw my airplane for the first time ( i won ’ t draw my airplane , it would be a drawing far too complicated for me ) , he asked me : “ what ' s that thing there ? ”\n",
      "“ it ' s not a thing .\n",
      "it flies .\n",
      "it ' s an airplane .\n",
      "it ’ s my airplane . ”\n",
      "and i was proud to have him know that i could fly .\n",
      "then he cried : “ what ?\n",
      "you fell from the sky ! ”\n",
      "“ yes , ” i said modestly .\n",
      "“ oh !\n",
      "that ' s funny !\n",
      "... ”\n",
      "and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter , which irritated me very much .\n",
      "i prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously .\n",
      "then he added : “ so , you also come from the sky !\n",
      "what planet are you from ? ”\n",
      "i caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence , and i asked abruptly : “ so you come from another planet then ? ”\n",
      "but he didn ’ t answer .\n",
      "he shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane : “ it ' s true that you can ' t have come from far away in that thing ... ”\n",
      "and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while .\n",
      "then , taking my sheep out of his pocket , he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure .\n",
      "you can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about ‘ the other planets . ’\n",
      "so i tried to find out more : “ where are you from my little fellow ?\n",
      "where ’ s this ‘ where i live ’ of yours ?\n",
      "where do you take my sheep off to ? ”\n",
      "after a reflective silence he answered : “ what ' s good about the box you ’ ve given me is that at night , he can use it as a house . ”\n",
      "“ that ’ s right .\n",
      "and if you ’ re good , i ' ll give you a rope to tie him up with during the day .\n",
      "and a stake . ”\n",
      "the offer seemed to shock the little prince : “ tie him up ?\n",
      "what a funny idea ! ”\n",
      "“ but if you don ' t tie him up , he ’ ll wander off , and get lost . ”\n",
      "my friend broke into another peal of laughter : “ where do you think he ’ d go ! ”\n",
      "“ anywhere .\n",
      "straight ahead ... ”\n",

      "and geography , it ' s true , has served me well .\n",
      "i could recognize , at first glance , china from arizona .\n",
      "it ’ s very useful if you get lost at night .\n",
      "i have had , during my life , a lot of contact with many persons of consequence .\n",
      "i have lived a lot amongst the grownups .\n",
      "i have seen them from close up .\n",
      "it hasnt much improved my opinion of them .\n",
      "whenever i met one of them that seemed a bit more clear - sighted , i tried the experiment of showing them my drawing number one , that i ' ve always kept .\n",
      "i wanted to know if they were really a person of true understanding .\n",
      "but they always responded : “ it ' s a hat . ”\n",
      "so i would never speak to them of boa constrictors , nor of primeval forests , nor of the stars .\n",
      "i put myself at their level .\n",
      "i talked to them about bridge , golf , politics and neckties .\n",
      "and the grownup was glad to know such a sensible man .\n",
      "so i lived alone , without anyone i could really talk to , until a breakdown in the sahara desert , six years ago .\n",
      "something had broken in my engine .\n",
      "and as i had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers , i readied myself to try and carry out , all alone , the difficult repairs .\n",
      "for me it was a matter of life or death .\n",
      "i had hardly enough water to drink for a week .\n",
      "the first night i went to sleep on the sand , a thousand miles from any human habitation .\n",
      "i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean .\n",
      "so you can imagine my surprise when at daybreak , a funny little voice woke me up .\n",
      "it said : “ please ...\n",
      "draw me a sheep ! ”\n",
      "“ what ? ”\n",
      "“ draw me a sheep ! ”\n",
      "i jumped to my feet as if i ’ d been struck by lightning .\n",
      "i rubbed my eyes .\n",
      "i took a good look around me .\n",
      "and i saw a quite extraordinary little man , who was examining me seriously .\n",
      "here is the best portrait that , later , i managed to do of him .\n",
      "but my drawing , of course , is much less charming than its model .\n",
      "it ' s not my fault .\n",
      "i was discouraged in my career as a painter by the grownups , at the age of six , and i hadn ' t learned to draw anything except boa constrictors , closed and open .\n",
      "i stared at this sudden apparition wide eyed with astonishment .\n",
      "remember that i was a thousand miles from any inhabited region .\n",
      "and yet this little fellow seemed neither lost , nor half - dead with fatigue , nor starved or dying of thirst or fear .\n",
      "he looked nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert , a thousand miles from any inhabited region .\n",
      "when i finally managed to speak , i said : “ but — what are you doing here ? ”\n",
      "and he repeated , very slowly , as if it was something very serious : “ please ...\n",
      "draw me a sheep ... ”\n",
      "when a mystery is too overpowering , one dare not disobey .\n",
      "absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death , i took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen .\n",
      "but then i remembered that i had mainly studied geography , history , arithmetic and grammar , and i told the little fellow ( a little crossly ) that i didn ’ t know how to draw .\n",
      "he replied : “ it doesn ' t matter .\n",
      "draw me a sheep . ”\n",
      "as i ’ d never drawn a sheep , i redrew for him one of the only two drawings that i was capable of .\n",
      "the one of the closed boa constrictor .\n",
      "and i was astounded to hear the little fellow respond : “ no !\n",
      "no !\n",
      "i don ’ t want an elephant inside a boa constrictor .\n",
      "a boa constrictor is very dangerous , and an elephant is very cumbersome .\n",
      "where i live everything is very small .\n",
      "i need a sheep .\n",
      "draw me a sheep . ”\n",
      "so i drew .\n",
      "he looked carefully , then said : “ no !\n",
      "this one ’ s already very sick .\n",
      "make another one . ”\n",
      "i drew again : my friend smiled gently and indulgently : “ you can see yourself ...\n",
      "this isn ’ t a sheep , it ' s a ram .\n",
      "it has horns ...\n",
      "“ so once again i redid my drawing : but it was rejected , like the previous ones : “ this one ’ s too old .\n",
      "i want a sheep that will live a long time . ”\n",
      "so , getting impatient , as i was eager to start dismantling my engine , i hastily sketched this drawing : and i snapped : “ this here is the box .\n",
      "the sheep you want is inside . ”\n",
      "but i was very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up : “ it ' s exactly the way i wanted !\n",
      "do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass ? ”\n",
      "“ why ? ”\n",
      "“ because where i ' m from everything is very small ... ”\n",
      "“ there will certainly be enough .\n",
      "i gave you a very small sheep . ”\n",
      "he leaned his head towards the drawing : “ not that small ...\n",
      "look !\n",
      "he ' s fallen asleep ... ”\n",
      "and that ' s how i met the little prince .\n",
      "it took me a long time to find out where he came from .\n",
      "the little prince , who asked me many questions , never seemed to hear my own .\n",
      "it was the words spoken by chance that , little by little , revealed everything to me .\n",
      "so , when he saw my airplane for the first time ( i won ’ t draw my airplane , it would be a drawing far too complicated for me ) , he asked me : “ what ' s that thing there ? ”\n",
      "“ it ' s not a thing .\n",
      "it flies .\n",
      "it ' s an airplane .\n",
      "it ’ s my airplane . ”\n",
      "and i was proud to have him know that i could fly .\n",
      "then he cried : “ what ?\n",
      "you fell from the sky ! ”\n",
      "“ yes , ” i said modestly .\n",
      "“ oh !\n",
      "that ' s funny !\n",
      "... ”\n",
      "and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter , which irritated me very much .\n",
      "i prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously .\n",
      "then he added : “ so , you also come from the sky !\n",
      "what planet are you from ? ”\n",
      "i caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence , and i asked abruptly : “ so you come from another planet then ? ”\n",
      "but he didn ’ t answer .\n",
      "he shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane : “ it ' s true that you can ' t have come from far away in that thing ... ”\n",
      "and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while .\n",
      "then , taking my sheep out of his pocket , he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure .\n",
      "you can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about ‘ the other planets . ’\n",
      "so i tried to find out more : “ where are you from my little fellow ?\n",
      "where ’ s this ‘ where i live ’ of yours ?\n",
      "where do you take my sheep off to ? ”\n",
      "after a reflective silence he answered : “ what ' s good about the box you ’ ve given me is that at night , he can use it as a house . ”\n",
      "“ that ’ s right .\n",
      "and if you ’ re good , i ' ll give you a rope to tie him up with during the day .\n",
      "and a stake . ”\n",
      "the offer seemed to shock the little prince : “ tie him up ?\n",
      "what a funny idea ! ”\n",
      "“ but if you don ' t tie him up , he ’ ll wander off , and get lost . ”\n",
      "my friend broke into another peal of laughter : “ where do you think he ’ d go ! ”\n",
      "“ anywhere .\n",
      "straight ahead ... ”\n",
